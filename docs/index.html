        <p id="subtitle"> How the blind in Invisible Man can still see skin color and how colorism drives racism </p>
        <br>
        <p> The titular protagnoist of Ralph Ellison's <em>Invisible Man</em> discovers his social invisibilty only after being repeated alienated because of his race. Until the book's final chapters, he believes that he can be seen through the power of his voice and growing understanding of the system, but no amount of social skills or verbal eloquence can render him visible because upon seeing his skin color, the blind masses whom Ralph Ellison depicts in <em>Invisible Man</em>, from the condescending Mr. Emerson to the Institute trustee Mr. Norton, who is ignorant of the lives of the very black students whose fates he considers his destiny, and Brother Tobitt, who claims to be superior in ethos to the invisible man because he dates a Black woman, shut their eyes to the humanity of the invisble man, as they have already been filled with prejudice. What has allowed racism of this form to persist for centuries and into today is the presence of a discriminating factor through which the oppressed can be quickly and subsconsciously identified and which can never be altered through social masking - skin color. Colorism is a primary means through which racism is propagated, and Ralph Ellison's subtle commentary on its ubiquitousness in <em>Invisible Man</em> in conjunction with works of art that more directly concern colorism help to contextualize the sense of alienation and invisibility that the invisible man, and every reader, experiences, for he rhetorically asks, "Who knows but that, on the lower frequencies, I speak for you?" (Ellison 450). </p>
